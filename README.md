### About
Flint is a lightweight web client for the Twitter 1.x API. <br>
It should be compatible with any Twitter 1.x reimplementation (e.g. DigUpTheBird) or similar (e.g. BlueTweety).
### Usage
For longevity reasons, Flint does not provide an API root (you have to specify it). <br>
Make sure to include the full URL **including the HTTP(S) protocol!**
### Notice
For security reasons (this client supports the insecure HTTP protocol), cookies only last 1 day before expiring.
